## Pretrained weights

Download the pretained weight of classification stage from

## Run each step:

1、Train the classification model and generate pesudo masks with the image-level label:

```python
python 1_train_stage1.py
```

2、Train the segmentation model with pesudo masks:

```python
python 2_train_stage2.py
```

3、Inference with the weights obtained from the segmentation stage：

```python
python inference.py
```
